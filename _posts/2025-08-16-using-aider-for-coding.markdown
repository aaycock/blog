## What is Aider?

Aider is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs in your terminal and helps you write, edit, and refactor code using natural language commands. Unlike other AI coding tools, Aider can directly modify your files and work with your entire codebase.

## Key Features

**Direct File Editing**: Aider can make precise changes to your code files using search/replace operations, ensuring accuracy and maintaining your existing code structure.

**Git Integration**: It automatically commits changes with descriptive messages, making it easy to track what the AI modified.

**Multi-File Awareness**: Aider understands your project structure and can work across multiple files simultaneously.

## Getting Started

Install Aider via pip:
```bash
pip install aider-chat
```

Then run it in your project directory:
```bash
aider
```

Simply describe what you want to change in natural language, and Aider will propose specific code modifications.

## Why I Like It

Aider bridges the gap between AI assistance and practical coding. It's particularly useful for refactoring, adding features, and fixing bugs across multiple files while maintaining clean git history.

The ability to make precise, surgical changes to existing code makes it invaluable for maintaining large codebases.
