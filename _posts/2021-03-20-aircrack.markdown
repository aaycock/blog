As a Wi-Fi professional, it is important to understand the tools used by bad actors to attack your networks. In this post, I'm going to show you how easy it is to crack a PSK using open source tools and a dictionary of potential passphrases. Hopefully, this will illustrate why PSK-based security may not be sufficient and why 802.1x measures should be considered in sensitive environments.

First, you'll need to capture specific 802.11 packets on the network by [putting your adapter into monitor mode][monitor].

We are looking for EAPOL packets. Once monitor mode is enabled, you can capture the packets you need with the following:
```
tcpdump -lw /tmp/packet.cap -Z root -i mon0 ether proto 0x888e or type mgt
```

You must capture the entire 4-way handshake process in order to proceed.

Once you have the capture, you can use `aircrack-ng` to compare the PSK used to a dictionary of potential passphrases. 

```
aircrack-ng /tmp/packet.cap -w /tmp/list -l /tmp/output.key -e PiFi-MAC
```

If the passphrase is in the dictionary, it will be found:

Hopefully this post illustrates why you should carefully consider the strength of security in your Wi-Fi network. At a minimum, be sure to avoid commonly used passphrases if you intend to block unauthorized users. Better yet, implement certificate-based, 802.1x security measures to secure your network.
