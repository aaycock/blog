After years of building software products, we are launching a new division of NextThing Consulting along with a suite of technology products to be released over the coming months.

Throughout my career, I've worked with talented teams on everything from AI to IoT to high-volume backend systems. These experiences have shaped my philosophy that good products come from combining technical expertise with an understanding of what users actually want.

NextThing Consulting reflects this approach. We're focused on building products that solve real problems that we've encountered in the field. Our goal is simpleâ€”create tools that people genuinely enjoy using. 

## Coming Soon
In the weeks ahead, we'll share details about specific products, discuss our development process, and explore some of the technical decisions behind our work. We'll talk about what we're building and why we think it matters.

Whether you're a developer, potential partner, or someone interested in thoughtful product development, we invite you to follow along.

Stay tuned for our first product announcement coming soon.

Welcome to NextThing Consulting.
